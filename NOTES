Notes for BACKBONE MVC
view - properties
    el - the element.
    ui - marionette
    	ui allows for binding variables to elements. 
    	faster than searching them up all the time
    templateHelpers - functions that can be used in your template
    attributes - can pass in attributes in the form of an object {}

    -most views are passed in a set of options. 
    	you can set it as a parameter in your initialize function
    	or you can access it through this.options


Trying to implement Templates
	-Can I load a template locally without a server
		-Fixed by changing the settings on Chrome shortcut you can bypass the security

Composite View - has both a model and a collection view used for extra text
Collection View - only draws item views
