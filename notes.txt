MAKE SURE YOU ARE WORKING IN TEMPLATING BRANCH
WILL MERGE AFTER templating is working

NOTES FOR BACKBONE MVC
view - properties
    el is the element.
    ui is marionette
    	ui allows for binding variables to elements. faster than searching them up all the time

Trying to implement Templates
	-Can I load a template locally without a server
		-Fixed BY changing the settings on Chrome shortcut you can bypass the security

How do i avoid appending all elements manually
